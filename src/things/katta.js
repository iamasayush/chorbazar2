        A Katta is a small, handmade firearm often crafted from readily available materials. 
        These improvised weapons are typically used for self-defense or in situations where conventional firearms are not accessible. 
        While Kattas are simple in design, they are functional and capable of firing a single shot. 
        
        Due to their unregulated nature, Kattas are often associated with criminal activities, 
        but they also highlight the ingenuity and resourcefulness of their makers. 
        Their construction and use vary widely, reflecting the diverse contexts in which they are created.
