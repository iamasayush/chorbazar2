        A bomber is a military aircraft designed to attack ground and naval targets by dropping bombs, launching missiles, or deploying other munitions. 
        These aircraft are typically equipped with advanced targeting systems and large payload capacities, allowing them to deliver precise and devastating strikes. 
        Bombers come in various types, including strategic bombers, which are designed for long-range missions, and tactical bombers, which operate closer to the battlefield. 
        
        Modern bombers, such as the B-2 Spirit, are often equipped with stealth technology, enabling them to evade enemy radar and defenses. 
        Historically, bombers played a crucial role in major conflicts, including World War II, where they were used for strategic bombing campaigns. 
        Today, bombers remain an essential component of military air forces, capable of projecting power and delivering rapid responses to emerging threats.
