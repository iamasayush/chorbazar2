        A machine gun is a fully automatic firearm capable of rapid, sustained fire. 
        These weapons are designed for use in military operations, providing suppressive fire to support infantry and other units. 
        Machine guns are typically mounted on tripods, vehicles, or aircraft, but some models are portable and can be operated by a single soldier. 
        
        Modern machine guns are equipped with advanced features, such as quick-change barrels and belt-fed ammunition systems, 
        allowing them to deliver high rates of fire over extended periods. 
        Their versatility and firepower make them a critical asset in modern warfare.
