        A dragger is a specialized type of boat used for dragging nets, equipment, or other materials in marine environments. 
        Commonly employed in commercial fishing, draggers are equipped with winches and other machinery to deploy and retrieve nets, 
        making them essential for harvesting fish and other seafood. 
        
        These boats are designed to operate in various conditions, from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea environments. 
        Dragger crews often work long hours, braving challenging weather and sea conditions to ensure a successful catch. 
        Beyond fishing, draggers are also used in industries such as marine construction and environmental cleanup, 
        demonstrating their versatility and importance in maritime operations.
