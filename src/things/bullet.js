        A bullet is a small, metal projectile fired from a firearm. 
        Typically made of lead or other dense materials, bullets are designed to travel at high speeds and deliver kinetic energy to a target. 
        They come in various shapes and sizes, tailored for different purposes, such as hunting, self-defense, or military use. 
        
        Modern bullets are often encased in a cartridge, which includes gunpowder and a primer to ignite the propellant. 
        Advances in bullet design have led to specialized types, such as hollow-point bullets for controlled expansion and armor-piercing rounds for penetrating hard targets. 
        As a fundamental component of firearms, bullets have played a significant role in shaping history and modern warfare.
