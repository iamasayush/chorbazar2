        A buggy is a lightweight, open-air vehicle designed for off-road use. 
        These vehicles are known for their agility and ability to traverse rough terrains, making them popular for recreational activities and desert racing. 
        Buggies often feature large, wide tires for better traction, a sturdy frame for durability, and a high ground clearance to navigate obstacles. 
        
        Originally developed for utility purposes, buggies have evolved into specialized vehicles used in motorsports and adventure tourism. 
        Their compact size and maneuverability make them ideal for exploring challenging landscapes, from sandy dunes to rocky trails. 
        Whether used for work or play, buggies offer a thrilling and versatile driving experience.
