        A grenade is a small, hand-held explosive device designed to be thrown or launched at a target. 
        Grenades are commonly used in military operations for clearing enemy positions, 
        creating diversions, or disabling equipment. 
        
        Modern grenades come in various types, including fragmentation grenades, which disperse shrapnel upon detonation, 
        and smoke grenades, which create a cloud of smoke for signaling or concealment. 
        Their compact size and versatility make grenades an essential tool in combat scenarios, 
        providing soldiers with a powerful and portable means of attack.
