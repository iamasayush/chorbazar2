        A grenade launcher is a weapon designed to launch grenades over greater distances than can be achieved by hand. 
        These launchers come in various forms, including standalone weapons, attachments for rifles, and automatic systems. 
        
        Grenade launchers are used in military and law enforcement operations for a variety of purposes, 
        such as clearing enemy positions, delivering non-lethal munitions, or providing indirect fire support. 
        Their ability to deliver explosive payloads with precision and range makes them a valuable asset in modern combat.
