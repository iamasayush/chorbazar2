                    WELCOME TO CHOR BAZAAR
                </p>

                <p>
                    THE MOST EXCLUSIVE ONE-RUPEE MARKETPLACE ON EARTH!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dear Valued (and Curious) Visitor,
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for stopping by Chor Bazaar, the world’s only online shop where everything costs just ONE RUPEE.
                    Yes, you heard it right! Whether it’s a tiny bullet or a massive aircraft carrier, it’s all just one rupee here.
                    Don’t ask us how — it’s magic, or maybe just a joke.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before you start imagining yourself driving tanks or flying fighter jets you just “bought” for a rupee,
                    please, read this message till the very end. Trust us, it’s worth it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here’s the deal: Chor Bazaar is NOT a real store. It’s a fun little project by Ayush Dwivedi.
                    All those cool things — missiles, AK-47s, helicopters, trucks, and whatever else you see — are just pictures.
                    You can add them to your cart all day long, but buying? Nope, that part doesn’t exist. Sorry to disappoint!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Important (but not scary) disclaimer:
                    This is NOT a website for terrorists or anyone looking to start World War III.
                    If you thought that, please don’t. We’re just having some harmless fun here.
                    No actual weapons are being sold. Pinky promise.
                </p>

                <p className="text-red-500 font-semibold">
                    ⚠️ And please, for the love of humor and national security — <u>DO NOT</u> complain to the police, army,
                    government officials, or the cyber crime cell. They have real problems to deal with, and this site
                    is not one of them. It's just a sarcastic, over-engineered joke made by a guy with too much free time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So go ahead, add all the tanks, jets, and rockets you want to your cart. Just remember —
                    it’s all a prank! This is a project, a joke, a web dev exercise, and nothing more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting Chor Bazaar — where your wildest (and most illegal-sounding) shopping dreams go to chill.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Happy “Shopping,” and don’t take us too seriously!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cheers,
                </p>
